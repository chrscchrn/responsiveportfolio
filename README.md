# responsiveportfolio

MOTIVATION/TECH/CREDITS
    My portfolio has a clean and minimal responsive design. It has been tested on various phones with different screen sizes. I wanted to make the layout especially simple for the sake of mobile devices. I think, though there are many good designs with more elements and features, simplicity looks best on mobile devices. Though there may not be many elements, this portfolio has up-to-date technology including Jquery, Javascript, CSS, and popper.js powered by Bootstrap. My own css file is also utilized. In this file I have designs which were partially influenced by creators whose work I have found exciting. In the CSS file there is credit given to the appropriate creators. 

CONTENT
    In the index.html file you will find semantic HTML, responsive layout, responsive images with and without links, and a navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar uses the most technology out of any other component. (Jquery, Javascript, CSS, and popper.js).
    
CREDIT
    The CSS is partially influenced because I wanted to use very clean and well designed elements for mobile devices, that's the only way I enjoy using the internet on my phone anyways. The influenced parts are the blurred boxes, and the responsive background image.
